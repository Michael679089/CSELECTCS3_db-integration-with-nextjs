Laboratory Activity: PostgreSQL Database Integration with Next.js

Title: Build a Web Application with PostgreSQL Integration in Next.js
Objective: By the end of this laboratory activity, students should be able to:
• Develop a simple web application using Next.js.
• Integrate a PostgreSQL database into the application.
• Demonstrate CRUD operations between the frontend and the database.

Instructions: Create a basic web application using Next.js with the following requirements:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (locally or using a cloud service).
2. Use Prisma as the ORM to connect Next.js to PostgreSQL.
3. Define at least one model (e.g., User, Task, or Product) in the Prisma schema.
4. Create the appropriate API routes in Next.js to perform CRUD operations on the model.
5. Build frontend pages that:
   o Display a list of records from the database.
   o Include forms to add and update records.
   o Allow deletion of records.
6. Ensure use of environment variables to store sensitive data (e.g., database URL).
   Deliverables:
7. PDF report containing:
   o Screenshots of the app interface
   o GitHub link of your source code

Notes:

1. prisma is my database folder. Just like in Laravel.
